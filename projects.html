                    <h3>Gameboy Emulator</h3>
                    <p>
                        I made a <a href="">Gameboy Emulator</a> towards the end of last summer. 
                        I think I learned a <em>bunch</em> from the project, and it's a great
                        project to show off.
                    </p>

                        The startup screen for Game Boy Color running in my emulator
                    </labeled-image>
                    <p>
                        Ultimately, it boiled down to painstakingly reading through every detail 
                        on how the Game Boy works, which was pretty much only possible due to 
                        <a href="https://gbdev.io/pandocs/">PanDocs</a>. I implemented every 
                        OP-code, every quirk with the PPU (pixel-processing unit), every 
                        timing between PPU and CPU. Slowly but surely, I made it into a 
                        working machine, until it was finally done.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The feeling of seeing the startup screen work for the first time is 
                        like no other. It really is a special kind of magic to have worked 
                        so close to the computer-level functionality of a device and then 
                        have it function.

                    <h3>Catan in the Terminal</h3>
                    <p>
                        I made a game of Catan that runs in the terminal, which you can find 
                        <a href="https://github.com/HugoIngelsson/Catan">here</a>. I put a lot of 
                        effort into making it look good in the terminal using ANSI codes, which is 
                        harder said than done. I had to create my own rendering system and artwork 
                        (especially hard since the pixels aren't 1x1 but rather in a weird aspect 
                        ratio), and this is of course on top of all of the game logic and player 
                        inputs I had to program.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I think the coolest thing about this project to me is that it's all just 
                        in native Java, so pretty much any system that supports ANSI escape codes 
                        can run the app. Maybe I missed an opportunity to learn some other framework 
                        when making this instead, but I think it was a good chance to get into the 
                        meats of how to build something ground up.

                    <h3>Concard</h3>
                    <p>
                        This one's a bit different because it was a group project for CSE
                        110 (Software Engineering). We ended up building <b>Concard</b>, a
                        website where people can design their own business cards (somewhat
                        similar to Figma).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I think the project (and the class overall) was an insightful experience,
                        giving me a chance to work in a team in a way I've never had to before.
                        I also think our final project is pretty cool&mdash;we decided to create
                        something with a lot of depth, and I think we managed to execute well on it.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Chess AI</h3>
                    <p>
                        One cool thing I made was as part of
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne40a5LkK6A">Sebastian Lague's Chess Bot Challenge</a>, 
                        where, as the name suggests, I built a chess bot that then competed against 
                        other people's bots in a tournament. Ultimately, I placed 111th out of 624 
                        competitors, which I think is decent enough since the competition was open to anyone
                        who wanted to participate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It did have a twist, however, which was that bots were restricted to the number of 
                        "tokens" they could contain, so you couldn't just up and copy Stockfish as your 
                        submission. This led to a bunch of bad code; this is one of my favorite snippets 
                        from what I submitted:
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>
    ulong[,] packedTables = {
        {0x0358305008132370,0x02339AA00477FDB0}, // pawns middlegame
        {0x08BAA8727ADCCB92,0x8CFEECA7AEFFECB7}, // knights middlegame
        {0x1667886096ADACA8,0x699CD8C759AEFB95}, // bishops middlegame
        {0x493162304D958663,0x9EB88975CFDA8AB8}, // rooks middlegame
        {0x2014722629CF8980,0x5C9DBEA02AA8A9D7}, // queen middlegame
        {0x0112265D0011247F,0x0001146A00011248}, // king middlegame
        {0x0C8532000A843120,0x096432500FA54530}, // pawns endgame
        {0x035676401569B854,0x559CCA969CDFEEC9}, // knights endgame
        {0x2558884038DBAB95,0x4BC9CB847CDFFEC9}, // bishops endgame
        {0xE8943902686A6220,0xFF392551C4A39352}, // rooks endgame
        {0x04678531379AB973,0x58ADDA846ACFFCB7}, // queen endgame
        {0x1377874049DDCA83,0x59EFDDA66AEFDDA6}  // king endgame
    };
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>
                        A central strategy in building a chess bot is to evaluate each piece's value relative 
                        to where on the board it is. Doing this naively, as with a simple 8x8 2D array for each 
                        piece, takes up <strong>way</strong> too many tokens, however, so I needed to compress the info much further. 
                        That's where the above comes from: it's more efficient to store each value as a byte 
                        part of a long and then unpack the value every time you need it, at least from a 
                        token perspective.

                    <h3>Battlecode</h3>
                    <p>
                        This is a <a href="https://battlecode.org/">competition</a> where you build an AI to play in a 
                        real-time strategy (RTS) game (much like Starcraft, if you've heard of it) hosted 
                        by MIT. Each agent in the game has its own brain which you must program, and whoever 
                        beats their opponent at achieving the objective wins the match. I've competed two years 
                        in a row with two of my friends, and this year we made it into the top 16 
                        (winning us a free trip to Boston and $500).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are a couple of reasons why the competition is so challenging (and fun!). First, 
                        you only program the brains of individual robots, who are all part of a team, and there 
                        isn't a direct way for them to influence each others' actions. They thus have to operate 
                        on some kind of shared strategy. Furthermore, individual robots only have a limited sensing 
                        distance, so the small amount of messaging that robots do get has to be used to organize over 
                        the entire map. Finally, robots are restricted on how much bytecode (effectively computational 
                        power) they're allowed each round, meaning you not only have to manage actual in-game 
                        resources but also how efficiently the robots operate.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Competitive Programming</h3>
                    <p>
                        Since getting to college, I've also gotten into competitive programming. I joined 
                        the ICPC club at UCSD and have competed at the SoCal regional two years in a row 
                        now, placing 7th last year's fall.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's competition season once again, so hopefully I can top last year's performance!
                        I'll be competing in the middle of November, wish me luck!
